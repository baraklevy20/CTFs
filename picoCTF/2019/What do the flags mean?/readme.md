# Challenge
What do the flags mean?

# Solution
We see a list of flags that don't look like they belong to any country, so we google one of them - "blue cross on yellow flag" and find out they're international maritime signal flags. We go through the list of flags and what letter/number each of them represent and get the flag.

Flag: `PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}`
