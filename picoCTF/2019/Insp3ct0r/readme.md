# Solution
We open the website and see it uses HTML, CSS and JS, located at:
* https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/63975/
* https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/63975/mycss.css
* https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/63975/myjs.js

We open each file and find the flag:
* In html - `<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->`.
* In CSS - `/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */`
* In JS - `/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?d3db9182} */`

Flag: `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?d3db9182}`
